# Queues
Implementation of queue without using built-in functions and using capacity.

Initial size of queue would be a constant value which gets doubled when extra element are added to it. A queue overflow message will not be diplayed, because if it exceeds the queue size during insertion of additional element, then the size of the queue gets doubled.
